# Apollo Protocol: 4D Activity Editor
> Activity Model Development Tool

This application is a lightweight web application to produce activity models based on the principles of 4-Dimensionalism (4D) whilst hiding the model complexity from end users.

## Introduction

Knowing what information is needed to support any business activity is not easy. Especially engineering activities such as product assembly and management of assets throughout their lifecycle. 
It is crucial that relevant information requirements can be discovered by following a standardised and thorough approach to enable good, ongoing information management.

By creating 4D activity diagrams, you are provided with the means to document the information required consistently. 
The information output of which can be analysed as logical diagrams or machine-readable data for expanded data integration.
Well constructed activity models can aid business process improvement, information quality management, performance measurement and planning.

This prototype uses the techniques laid out in [“An Integrated Approach to Information Management: Identifying decisions and the information required for them using activity and process models”](https://www.cdbb.cam.ac.uk/news/publication-integrated-approach-information-management-identifying-decisions-and-information).  Discover the value of using data to model activities and what’s involved in creating them.

The editor is built upon the principles of 4-Dimensionalism. By design the user interface hides the theory and complexity, whilst providing you the benefits of such a comprehensive approach. This editor is part of ongoing research, and as such [feedback](https://github.com/Apollo-Protocol/4d-activity-editor/discussions) is greatly appreciated.

The application is a next.js web application built around the editor providing support and guidance to get started. When locally hosted all data remains on the device.


## Getting Started

An online free access version of the last released editor tool is hosted by GitHub Pages [here](https://apollo-protocol.github.io/4d-activity-editor/).

For running locally please follow the setup instructions in the editor-app readme found [here](editor-app/README.md).

### Examples

A series of diagram examples are included in the `./examples` folder [here](./examples/) that are supported by the tool in addition to the in-built examples.

## Contributing
