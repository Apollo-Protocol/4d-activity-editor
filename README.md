# 4D Activity Editor

This prototype Activity Modeller uses the techniques laid out in [“An Integrated Approach to Information Management: Identifying decisions and the information required for them using activity and process models”](https://www.cdbb.cam.ac.uk/news/publication-integrated-approach-information-management-identifying-decisions-and-information).  Discover the value of using data to model activities and what’s involved in them.

The application is a next.js web application built around the editor to provide support and guidance, as well as allow for hosting. When locally spun up all data remains on the device.

The editor is built upon the principles of 4-Dimensionalism. By design the user interface hides the theory and complexity, whilst providing you the benefits of such a comprehensive approach. This editor is part of ongoing research, and as such [feedback](link-to-discussion) is greatly appreciated.
